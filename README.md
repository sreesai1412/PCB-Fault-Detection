# PCB-Fault-Detection
Image classification task to identify defective Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs).

## Data
The raw train and test data containing RGB images of the Printed Circuit Boards can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11-WROAtjIFlhLVrW0aLnfpno-9md6OnU?usp=sharing)

The NumPy arrays obtained by pre-processing the raw data can also be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11-WROAtjIFlhLVrW0aLnfpno-9md6OnU?usp=sharing)

## Models

The [PCBFaultDetection.ipynb](https://github.com/sreesai1412/PCB-Fault-Detection/master/PCBFaultDetection.ipynb) notebook contains the final image classification model for classifying defective PCBs and its evaluation.

The [ClassificationModels.ipynb](https://github.com/sreesai1412/PCB-Fault-Detection/master/ClassificationModels.ipynb) notebook contains the implementation of different image classification models.

The other folders contain the implementation of various ResNet models and their evaluation on the defective PCB classification task.
